Project Overview: Call Center Analysis Dashboard

Objective:
The goal of this project was to develop a comprehensive and interactive dashboard using Power BI to analyze and visualize key performance metrics for a call center. The primary focus was on improving operational efficiency, agent performance, and customer satisfaction.

Key Features and Metrics:

Average Speed of Answer:

Displays the average time taken to answer calls across the call center.
Current average speed of answer is 67.60 seconds.
Call Resolution Rate:

Tracks the percentage of calls resolved successfully.
Provides a clear visual representation of resolved versus unresolved calls.
Agent Performance Statistics:

Detailed metrics for each agent including the number of calls answered, satisfaction ratings, and average speed of answer.
Helps identify top performers and areas where additional training may be needed.
Monthly Call Volume Trends:

Analyzes call volume on a monthly basis to identify trends and peak periods.
Aids in optimizing staffing levels and resource allocation.
Overall Satisfaction Rating:

Visual gauge showing the average satisfaction rating, currently at 3.40 out of 5.
Provides a quick snapshot of customer satisfaction levels.
Visual Elements:

Interactive Filters:
Year, Resolved Status, and Agent filters allow users to drill down into specific data subsets for more detailed analysis.
Charts and Graphs:
Pie charts for answered and resolved calls.
Bar charts displaying the number of calls per month.
Tabular data for detailed agent statistics.
Technical Implementation:

Data Source:
Integrated various data sources to pull call center metrics into Power BI.
Data Transformation:
Used Power Query for data cleaning and transformation.
Visualization:
